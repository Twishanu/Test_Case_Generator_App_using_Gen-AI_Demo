Harry Potter, an orphan known as "The Boy Who Lived," is a wizard who attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Sorted into Gryffindor house, he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. His main adversary is Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard who murdered his parents, James and Lily Potter.

The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is a globally beloved collection of seven fantasy novels chronicling the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. The main story arc follows Harry's journey at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and his epic struggle against the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who murdered Harry's parents and seeks to conquer the wizarding world. The books are set in a hidden magical world that coexists alongside the non-magical, or "Muggle," world.

The central themes of the series are powerful and resonant, including friendship, love, sacrifice, and the eternal battle between good and evil. Each book corresponds to a school year at Hogwarts, where Harry learns magic, plays Quidditch (a popular wizarding sport), and unravels the mysteries of his past and destiny. He is often guided by the wise headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and faces challenges from the sinister Potions master, Severus Snape, and the ruthless Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters.

The wizarding world is rich with detail, featuring magical creatures like dragons and house-elves, enchanted objects, and a complex political structure governed by the Ministry of Magic. The series has expanded into a massive franchise, including eight films, a play ("Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"), and the "Fantastic Beasts" film series, which explores the world before Harry's time. The original books have sold over 600 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history and a cultural phenomenon that has captivated generations of readers.
